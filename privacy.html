TACHIN.AI PRIVACY POLICY
  </p>
  <p>
  Last Updated: 5/19/2025
  </p>
  <p>
This Privacy Policy describes how Tachin.ai (“Tachin,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collects, uses, discloses and otherwise processes information about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with our business-to-business services (the “Services” or “Company B2B Services”).  This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when an Authorized User (as referenced in the Terms of Use) accesses or uses our websites and other online products and services offered under the Company B2B Services or otherwise interacts with us, such as through our customer support channels. Where we process personal information in the course of providing the Company B2B Services, we do so on behalf of and pursuant to agreements with our B2B customers, rather than pursuant to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
This Privacy Policy is effective as of the “Last Updated” data above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date. Where required by law, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the Services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

This information may be used by 1health and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices (if in the US) or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ (if in the EU). Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through mobile apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

  </p>

 <p>
We also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of customized campaigns on third-party platforms (such as Facebook). As part of these ad campaigns, we or third-party platforms may convert information about you, such as your email address and phone number, into a unique value that can be matched with a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and serve you advertising that is customized to your interest. Note that the third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see these types of customized ads.

1health does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to the extent received from a web browser. Because there currently is not a universally accepted technological or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals as reflections of user choice, we do not respond to them at this time. Once such technology is created and has received applicable regulatory approval, we will consider (a) whether it is possible; and (b) if so, how it can be incorporated within our environment in the future.

As described in this Privacy Policy, we may share your personal information with our partners, third parties or affiliates for our marketing or other purposes, including such third parties’ own purposes. To the extent such sharing is considered a “sale” under the CCPA, as a California resident, you have the right to opt out of these sales at any time by submitting this form found by visiting our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” webpage or emailing us at support@tachin.ai.

You may make these requests by submitting this form or emailing us at support@tachin.ai. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your registered account or a recent interaction with us. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

  </p>
   <p>
If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. If you are an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us.

  </p>
   <p>
We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA. They include the following:<br>
<br> - Periodic Contests or Sweepstakes. Each contest or sweepstake have its own terms and conditions describing how an eligible consumer may opt-in as well as withdraw from the contest or sweepstake.
<br> - Loyalty Program. Earn points for qualifying submissions to or purchases from 1health. A member of the loyalty program can opt-in by creating a 1health account and can withdraw at any time from this program by submitting this form found on our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” webpage or emailing us at support@tachin.ai.
